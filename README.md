# Sokoban-Competition-SDU
University contest in sokoban (Lego Mindstorm robots pushing tomato cans)

The solver code was borrowed from some very smart man on github, but I somehow lost him.. Sorry I can't give any credit to his name. Anyways I changed some stuff in the solver part, to give 'local' directions rather than 'global', to be compatible with the control software on the robot.

The robot code is written for Lego MINDSTORMS EV3
